# HouseOnTheHill-CustomHauntRoller-Console
 A homebrew mechanic for a board game called 'House on the Hill', where the haunt roll to trigger a possible haunt is now more mysterious. Nobody knows what the haunt threshold is and is randomised with each game, to add more ominosity to the game. Console Version.
